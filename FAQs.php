        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Pet insurance is designed to help pet owners manage the costs of unexpected medical expenses for their furry friends. Coverage typically includes:</p>

                <li><strong>Chronic Conditions:</strong> Long-term illnesses such as diabetes, arthritis, and allergies that may require ongoing care and medication.</li>
                <li><strong>Surgeries:</strong> Procedures for both emergencies and non-critical issues, including spaying/neutering, tumor removal, and fracture repairs.</li>

            <p>Some comprehensive plans may also offer optional add-ons for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wellness Care:</strong> Routine services like annual check-ups, vaccinations, and dental cleanings.</li>

        <!--This is the third question button-->
        <button class="faq-question">Are pre-existing conditions covered? ‚öïÔ∏è</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Pre-existing conditions are a common concern for pet owners when considering insurance coverage. Unfortunately, most pet insurance policies do not cover pre-existing conditions. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into what this means and what options might be available:</p>
            
            <h4>What are pre-existing conditions?</h4>
            <p>Pre-existing conditions refer to any illness, injury, or medical issue that your pet experienced before the start date of your insurance policy. These could include chronic diseases like diabetes or arthritis, previous injuries such as fractures, or hereditary conditions specific to certain breeds.</p>
            
            <h4>Why are pre-existing conditions excluded?</h4>
            <p>Pet insurance is designed to provide coverage for unforeseen events, not for medical issues that were known or diagnosed prior to the policy's start date. Covering pre-existing conditions would make it challenging for insurance providers to maintain affordable plans for all pet owners.</p>
            
            <h4>What happens if my pet develops a new condition?</h4>
            <p>Once your policy is active, coverage generally includes treatment for new illnesses or injuries. For example, if your pet is diagnosed with a condition like heart disease after the policy begins, the treatments and medications for managing the condition may be covered.</p>
            
            <h4>Are there exceptions?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Some providers may offer limited coverage for pre-existing conditions that are considered "curable." This means that if your pet has been symptom-free for a specific period (e.g., 6 or 12 months), coverage might be available for related issues.</li>
                <li>Hereditary or congenital conditions may be covered by certain plans, provided they were not diagnosed before the policy began.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What are my options?</h4>
            <p>If your pet has a pre-existing condition, you can still benefit from pet insurance by enrolling in a plan to cover future unexpected issues. Additionally, some providers offer specialized plans or add-ons for managing chronic conditions that develop after enrollment.</p>

        <!--This is the fourth question button-->
        <button class="faq-question">What's the best plan for my pet? üêïüêà</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Choosing the best plan for your pet depends on several factors, including their breed, age, lifestyle, and medical history. Let's break it down:</p>
            
            <h4>Factors to Consider:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breed:</strong> Certain breeds are prone to specific health conditions. For example, large dog breeds like Golden Retrievers may benefit from a plan that includes orthopedic coverage, while cats may need coverage for kidney issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Younger pets typically require plans focused on vaccinations, wellness check-ups, and preventive care. Older pets may need more comprehensive coverage for chronic conditions or frequent medical visits.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical History:</strong> If your pet has a history of illnesses or conditions, it's important to choose a plan that offers ongoing care for related treatments.</li>
                <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Active pets or those frequently outdoors may benefit from plans that include accident coverage for injuries or emergency care.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Our Recommended Plans:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Plan:</strong> Ideal for essential needs like vaccinations, annual check-ups, and routine care. This plan is perfect for young, healthy pets who need minimal medical interventions.</li>
                <li><strong>Premium Plan:</strong> Provides comprehensive protection, including coverage for accidents, illnesses, surgeries, and alternative therapies such as acupuncture or physiotherapy. Recommended for pets with specific health concerns or older pets needing ongoing care.</li>
                <li><strong>Wellness Add-On:</strong> Perfect for owners looking to expand routine care options like dental cleaning, grooming, and behavioral therapy. This add-on enhances both Basic and Premium plans.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>How to Choose:</h4>
            <p>Take time to assess your pet's current health and potential future needs. For younger pets, a Basic Plan with Wellness Add-Ons might be sufficient. For older or high-risk pets, the Premium Plan ensures peace of mind with broader coverage.</p>

        <!--This is the sixth question button-->
        <button class="faq-question">Does pet insurance cover routine care? ü©∫</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, many pet insurance providers offer routine care coverage as part of their plans or as an optional add-on. Routine care focuses on 
                preventive healthcare to keep your pet healthy throughout the year. Here's what is typically included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Coverage for essential shots to protect your pet from diseases such as rabies, distemper, or feline leukemia.</li>
                <li><strong>Annual Check-Ups:</strong> Regular wellness exams to monitor your pet's overall health and detect potential issues early.</li>
                <li><strong>Dental Cleaning:</strong> Maintaining your pet's oral hygiene can help prevent infections, gum disease, and tooth decay.</li>
                <li><strong>Flea, Tick, and Heartworm Prevention:</strong> Coverage for preventive treatments and medications to safeguard your pet 
                against pests and parasites.</li>

        <!--This is the seventh question button-->
        <button class="faq-question">What happens if I miss a payment? üí≥</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We understand that life can be unpredictable, and missing a payment occasionally happens. Here's what you can expect if a payment is missed:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Policy Suspension:</strong> If a payment is overdue, your policy may be temporarily suspended. During this period, claims may 
                not be processed until the balance is settled.</li>
                <li><strong>Grace Period:</strong> Most policies include a grace period (typically 7-14 days) to allow you to make the payment without 
                penalties. Check your policy terms for details about your grace period.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinstatement:</strong> Once the payment is made, your policy will be reinstated, and coverage will resume. If the payment is 
                significantly delayed, you may need to contact our billing team to ensure smooth reinstatement.</li>
            </ol>
